# Principles of Scientific Writing

1. Clarity:

    Be Concise: Use clear and direct language. Avoid unnecessary words or complex sentences.
    Define Terms: Clearly define any technical terms or jargon.

   - **Example of Poor Clarity**: The phenomenon that we observed was, in many respects, not dissimilar to the outcomes that were previously documented in the literature on this subject.

   - **Revision**: The phenomenon we observed was similar to previously documented outcomes.
  
   - **Example of Jargon**: The chromatographic elucidation was efficacious in the delineation of the compound's molecular constituency.

   - **Revision**: The chromatography effectively identified the compound's molecular components.

   - **Example of Common Grammatical Errors**: Misusing "their" instead of "there", or "affect" instead of "effect", or "which" instead of "that".

   - **Revision**: Careful proofreading to correct such mistakes.

2. Accuracy:

    Be Precise: Use accurate and specific language to describe your findings.
    Check Facts: Ensure all information, data, and citations are correct.

   - **Example of Mistake**: Using ideas or data from other works without appropriate citation.

   - **Revision**: Providing full and proper citations for every source used.

3. Objectivity:

    Present Unbiased Views: Avoid personal opinions or biases in your writing.
    Report Findings Honestly: Present your results honestly, even if they didn’t meet your expectations or contradict your hypothesis.

   - **Non-Objective Writing**: Scientists, who obviously care deeply about our planet, believe that the blue-spotted frog must be conserved at all costs. Their findings, though they contradict popular opinion, are driven by a moral imperative to save this adorable and innocent species, which is clearly more important than any other consideration.
Revised Objective Writing:

   - **Revision**: Sevaral factors suspected to be impacting the blue-spotted frog population were investigated, but there were no significant negative effects detected. While there is a general consensus on the importance of species conservation, the blue spotted frog is more robust than anticipated, and conservation efforts for this species should be balanced with other environmental and economic considerations. 

In the objective revision, the writing is focused on the facts and findings rather than emotional or moral judgments. It acknowledges the complexity of conservation decisions without imposing a biased view of the species' importance.

4. Structure:

    Follow Standard Structure: Adhere to the typical structure of a scientific paper (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Abstract).
    Logical Flow: Ensure there is a logical flow from one section to the next.

   - **Example of Poor Structure**: Discussing results before explaining the methodology.
 
   - **Revision**: A clear progression from introduction, methodology, results, to discussion.

   - **Example of Poor Structure**: A long, uninterrupted section of text covering multiple topics.

   - **Revision**: Use of clear subheadings and separate paragraphs for each topic.

5. Coherence:

    Maintain Consistency: Be consistent in your use of terms, abbreviations, and formatting.
    Link Sections: Ensure each part of the paper connects logically to the others.

   - **Example of Inconsistent Tenses**: The study shows that the bacteria were resistant to antibiotics and they increase in number.
 
   - **Revision**: The study showed that the bacteria were resistant to antibiotics and increased in number.
  
6. Audience Awareness:

    Know Your Audience: Write with your audience’s level of knowledge in mind.
    Be Engaging: While maintaining professionalism, try to make your writing engaging.

   - **Example of Mistake**: Using highly technical language in a paper intended for a general audience.

   - **Improved**: Adjusting the language to match the audience's level of expertise.

7. Use of Visuals:

    Relevant Graphics: Use tables, figures, and charts to complement your text.
    Label Clearly: Ensure all visuals are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.

   - **Example of Mistake**: A graph with tiny, unreadable labels and no clear legend.

   - **Improved**: A graph with clear, legible labels, a concise legend, and a straightforward title.

8. Ethical Writing:

    Avoid Plagiarism: Always credit sources and ideas that are not your own.
    Disclose Conflicts of Interest: Be transparent about any potential conflicts of interest.

9. Revision and Feedback:

    Revise Thoroughly: Revise your drafts for clarity, coherence, and length.
    Seek Feedback: Get input from colleagues or mentors to improve your writing.

10. Adherence to Guidelines:

    Journal Guidelines: Follow specific guidelines provided by the journal or publisher.
    Referencing Style: Use the appropriate referencing style consistently throughout your paper.

Additional Tips:

* Active vs. Passive Voice: While the passive voice is traditional in scientific writing, using active voice can make your writing clearer and more engaging.

   - **Example of passive**: The experiment was conducted, and the data were analyzed by the team.
   
   - **Revision**: The team conducted the experiment and analyzed the data.

* Start with an Outline: Create an outline of your paper before you start writing to organize your thoughts and structure your arguments.

* Practice and Learn: Continuously practice and learn from peer-reviewed articles in your field to improve your scientific writing skills.

Conclusion:

Effective scientific writing is essential for communicating research findings clearly and accurately. It involves more than just presenting data; it's about telling a coherent, logical story of your research journey. Remember, good scientific writing can significantly impact the reception and understanding of your work in the scientific community.
