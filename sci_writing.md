4. Structure:

    Follow Standard Structure: Adhere to the typical structure of a scientific paper (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Abstract).
    Logical Flow: Ensure there is a logical flow from one section to the next.

5. Coherence:

    Maintain Consistency: Be consistent in your use of terms, abbreviations, and formatting.
